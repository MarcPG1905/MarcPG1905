# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with passion and the owner of some projects, like [Hectus](https://github.com/HectusNet) and [PooperMC](https://github.com/MarcPG1905/PooperMC).

## Current Projects

- **NeoBB** - Open source BlockBattles plugin for the Hectus Network.
- **Dreath** - A realistic survival game written in Kotlin and entirely from scratch without any game engine.
- **KtLibPG** - A Kotlin library with a wide range of utilities.
- **BotPG v2** - Discord bot for personal Discord servers.

## Programming Languages

- **Kotlin**: My most used language which I fell in love with.
- **Java**: The language I'm most experienced with.
- **Assembly**: x86_64, ARM, IA-64 and likely some other's that are similar.
- **C/C++**: Pretty decent at it.
